<h2>Joschmi / regular</h2>
<p>The designer for this typeface was originally joost schmidt who shaped the graphic design style we identify as bauhaus but was recreated by Flavia Zimbardi(<a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/hidden-treasures#fonts-section">Joschmi</a>) the reason this type face is unique is because it resembles old bond movie titles or films like the Great Gatsby, also because These modular shapes simply consist of half circles, quarter circles and square strokes with half-round terminals. Flavia completed schdmits work and added a full character set for contemporary use, adding upper case letters and different figure sets including old-style.
